        <p>
            Zen Garden is interesting because it allows people to take a pre-written structural HTML file and add CSS to design it. The example pages that Zen Garden provides all contain the same material but are drastically different in appearance. It accomplishes Zen Garden’s goal of highlighting the power of CSS in all that it can do to design a webpage.</p>

        <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/088/" class="website">Favorite Webpage</a> 
        <p>As in the reading, the CSS for this website utilizes the position schemes that allow for the image at the bottom of the page to remain “fixed” as a person scrolls down the side of the page as well as the “relative” command that shifts the content in relation to the normal flow. Additionally, the CSS for this webpage includes the “float” command in order to direct other elements to float around one. This is how the webpage is able to display the sidebar with the other elements directly next to it. </p>

             <a href=" http://www.csszengarden.com/213/"> Webpage with Extra CSS</a>
            <p>On this webpage, the CSS file includes the command “voice-family.” This is often used to indicate gender, age and name to point to a specific voice. In this particular file, the CSS includes “voice-family: inherit” which signifies that the computed value will be the same for the element’s parent. </p>
